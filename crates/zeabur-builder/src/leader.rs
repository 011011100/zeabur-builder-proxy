//! Leader election with the `coordination.k8s.io` Lease [`LEASE`] in the controller's namespace.
//!
//! Every replica watches, so its caches are ready when it takes the Lease. Only the holder
//! reconciles and sweeps. The webhook receiver runs on every replica: it only writes
//! `status.lastWebhookAt`.
//!
//! A Lease does not fence. If a holder stops renewing, two replicas can act for a short time.
//! A `BuildRun` name is a function of its trigger ([`crate::decide::run_name`]), so the second
//! create of the same run gets `409 Conflict`.
